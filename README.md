## Getting Started

This program is a straightforward console-based clock display that can be compiled and run on various platforms.

### Prerequisites

You will need a C compiler to build and run this program. If you don't have one already, you can install GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on Linux or use an integrated development environment (IDE) on Windows or macOS.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/awkwardpy/real-time-clock-display.git
   ```

2. Compile the C program using a C compiler. For example, with GCC:

   ```bash
   gcc real_time_clock.c -o real_time_clock -lm
   ```

3. Run the compiled program:
